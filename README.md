Web-based application for an automatic HVAC system  that aims to provide thermal comfort and improve the indoor air quality. Based on the environment inside the room the system should be able to automatically adjust the temperature with the help of fans, heaters, etc., create the ventilation for the air to refresh it after regular intervals of time to maintain the air quality. The input sensor data involves the temperature and air quality. The air quality can be measured in terms of Air Quality Index (AQI) values ranging from 0 to 500 degrees based on the presence of pollutants, refer below figure for standard benchmarks. On the basis of the sensed data we can adjust the temperature and ventilation accordingly, which also lead to efficient management of energy.

### Functions
The major function of our web application is to control the environment situations inside the building. It mainly collects the data from the sensor of environmental conditions , to be used by the HVAC system.

Some major function of the product are listed below:-

- Taking input from the sensor in the automatic mode.
- Update the HVAC by taking necessary actions based on the input.
- Taking input from the user in the manual mode.
- Showing output given by the implemented Automation HVAC system to the user.
- Send an alert message and pop up, if conditions cross the threshold.
- Keep a report of the HVAC performance.
- Some addition features like contact and chat.
